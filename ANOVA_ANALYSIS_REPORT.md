## 4. POST-HOC ANALYSIS

### Tukey's HSD Test (WiFi Speed → Task Abandonment)
The most significant finding was further analyzed:

**Significant Pairwise Differences**:
- Very Poor vs Poor WiFi: Mean difference = 1.70, p < 0.001
- Very Poor vs Average WiFi: Mean difference = 2.45, p < 0.001
- Very Poor vs Good WiFi: Mean difference = 2.50, p < 0.001

**Interpretation**: Students with very poor WiFi abandon tasks significantly more often than all other groups.

## 5. ASSUMPTIONS VALIDATION

### Normality Check (Shapiro-Wilk Test):
- WiFi Speed Score: W = 0.864, p = 0.004 (❌ Not Normal)
- Task Abandonment Score: W = 0.863, p = 0.004 (❌ Not Normal)
- Productivity Influence Score: W = 0.918, p = 0.052 (✅ Normal)

### Homogeneity of Variance (Levene's Test):
- WiFi Speed groups: W = 0.190, p = 0.902 (✅ Homogeneous variances)

**Note**: While some variables violate normality assumptions, ANOVA is robust to moderate violations, especially with balanced designs.

## 6. KEY FINDINGS AND IMPLICATIONS

### 6.1 Primary Findings:

1. **WiFi Speed is the Critical Factor**
   - Strongest predictor of task abandonment and time lost
   - Students with very poor WiFi are significantly more likely to abandon tasks
   - Effect sizes are large (η² > 0.25), indicating practical significance

2. **Peak Performance During High Usage Matters**
   - How WiFi performs during peak times significantly affects student productivity
   - Students experiencing poor peak performance lose more time and abandon more tasks

3. **Reliability Shows Weaker Associations**
   - While intuitively important, reliability alone doesn't show significant effects
   - May be because reliability issues are captured in other measures

4. **Outage Frequency Less Impactful Than Expected**
   - Frequency of outages doesn't significantly predict performance issues
   - Suggests that consistent poor performance is worse than intermittent outages

### 6.2 Practical Implications:

#### For IT Infrastructure:
- **Priority 1**: Improve baseline WiFi speed across campus
- **Priority 2**: Ensure good performance during peak usage times
- **Priority 3**: Address reliability issues (though less critical than speed)

#### For Academic Support:
- Students with poor connectivity may need:
  - Alternative access methods for critical tasks
  - Extended deadlines during connectivity issues
  - Offline backup options for essential coursework

#### For Future Research:
- Investigate specific activities most affected by poor connectivity
- Study long-term academic outcomes related to connectivity issues
- Examine coping strategies used by students with poor connectivity

## CONCLUSION

This comprehensive ANOVA analysis reveals that **WiFi speed is the most critical factor** affecting student productivity at IIT. The analysis provides strong statistical evidence (p < 0.001, large effect sizes) that poor WiFi speed leads to significantly more task abandonment and time lost. Peak performance during high usage also emerges as a key factor.

The findings suggest that infrastructure improvements should prioritize speed and peak-time performance over other factors like reducing outage frequency. These results provide a data-driven foundation for IT infrastructure planning and student support services.
