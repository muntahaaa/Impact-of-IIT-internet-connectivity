COMPLETE ANOVA ANALYSIS WORKFLOW EXPLANATION
IIT Internet Connectivity Impact on Student Productivity Study
===============================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project analyzes survey data from 24 IIT students to understand how internet 
connectivity factors affect academic productivity using comprehensive ANOVA testing.

===============================================================================
PHASE 1: DATA PREPARATION AND CLEANING
===============================================================================

1.1 DATA LOADING AND INSPECTION
   - Loaded Excel survey data: "The Impact of IIT Internet Connectivity on Student Productivity (Responses).xlsx"
   - Original dataset: 24 responses × 22 columns (including timestamp)
   - Identified categorical variables that needed numeric mapping for ANOVA

1.2 VARIABLE MAPPING STRATEGY
   All 21 survey variables (excluding timestamp) were systematically mapped to 
   ordinal numeric scales to preserve meaningful order while enabling statistical analysis:

   INFRASTRUCTURE VARIABLES:
   • Academic Year: First Year(1) → Second(2) → Third(3) → Fourth(4)
   • Device Capability: Mobile(1) → Laptop(2) → Desktop(3)
   • Residence: Shared apartment(1) → Family home(2) → On-campus(3)
   • WiFi Speed: Very Poor <5Mbps(1) → Poor 5-10Mbps(2) → Average 10-25Mbps(3) → Good 25-50Mbps(4)
   • Reliability: Unreliable <60%(1) → Moderate 60-85%(2) → Reliable 85-100%(3)
   • Peak Performance: Significantly slower(1) → Moderately slower(2) → Slightly slower(3) → No difference(4)
   • Outage Frequency: Very Frequently(1) → Frequently(2) → Occasionally(3) → Rarely(4) → Never(5)

   IMPACT VARIABLES:
   • Programming Impact: Hinders(1) → Neutral(2) → Enhances(3)
   • Collaboration: Hinders(1) → Basic(2) → Seamless(3)
   • Daily Hours: <1hr(1) → 1-2hr(2) → 2-4hr(3) → 4-6hr(4) → >6hr(5)
   • LMS Access: Often slow(1) → Sometimes slow(2) → Usually accessible(3) → Always fast(4)

   PERFORMANCE ISSUES (REVERSE CODED):
   • Task Abandonment: Very Frequently(1) → Frequently(2) → Occasionally(3) → Rarely(4) → Never(5)
   • Time Lost: >60min(1) → 31-60min(2) → 16-30min(3) → 1-15min(4) → 0min(5)

   PRODUCTIVITY MEASURES:
   • Productivity Influence: Not influenced 0-10%(1) → Slightly 11-25%(2) → Moderately 26-50%(3) → Highly 51-75%(4) → Extremely 76-100%(5)
   • Future Performance: No improvement(1) → Slight(2) → Moderate(3) → Significant(4) → Extreme(5)

1.3 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
   - Fixed mapping inconsistencies (e.g., "Slightly Influenced (11-25%)" mapping)
   - Verified all 24 responses retained (no data loss)
   - Created comprehensive_anova_data.csv with 20 numeric variables
   - Validated mapping ranges and distributions

===============================================================================
PHASE 2: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
===============================================================================

2.1 CORRELATION MATRIX ANALYSIS
   Generated 20×20 correlation matrix to understand variable relationships:
   - WiFi Speed ↔ Task Abandonment: Strong negative correlation (-0.75)
   - WiFi Speed ↔ Time Lost: Moderate negative correlation (-0.55)
   - Infrastructure variables generally positively correlated
   - Helped identify potential multicollinearity issues

2.2 SUMMARY STATISTICS
   Calculated descriptive statistics for all variables:
   - Count, mean, standard deviation, min/max, quartiles
   - Assessed data distribution characteristics
   - Identified potential normality issues
   - Validated data ranges and outliers

2.3 VARIABLE SELECTION FOR ANOVA
   Selected variables for different ANOVA analyses based on:
   - Theoretical importance (WiFi speed as primary predictor)
   - Data distribution characteristics
   - Practical significance for student outcomes

===============================================================================
PHASE 3: COMPREHENSIVE ANOVA TESTING

   SIGNIFICANT RESULTS:
   • WiFi Speed → Programming Impact: F(3,20) = 4.29, p = 0.017, η² = 0.39
     - Students with very poor WiFi had significantly lower programming scores
   • WiFi Speed → Collaboration Score: F(3,20) = 5.65, p = 0.006, η² = 0.46
     - Clear improvement in collaboration with better WiFi speeds
   
   NON-SIGNIFICANT RESULTS:
   • WiFi Speed → LMS Access: F = 2.34, p = 0.104
   • WiFi Speed → Productivity Influence: F = 0.58, p = 0.637

3.2 TWO-WAY ANOVA: WiFi Speed + Reliability vs Productivity
   Tested combined effects of WiFi speed and reliability on productivity:
   
   RESULTS: No significant effects found
   • WiFi Speed main effect: F = 0.003, p = 0.959
   • Reliability main effect: F = 0.163, p = 0.851
   • Interaction effect: F = 0.824, p = 0.530
   
   INTERPRETATION: Combined effects don't significantly predict productivity

3.3 MULTIPLE ONE-WAY ANOVAs: Infrastructure vs Performance Issues
   Systematically tested 8 relationships between infrastructure and problems:
   
   HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS:
   1. WiFi Speed → Task Abandonment: F(3,20) = 22.45, p < 0.001, η² = 0.529 ⭐⭐⭐
      - STRONGEST FINDING: Poor WiFi dramatically increases task abandonment
   
   2. WiFi Speed → Time Lost: F(3,20) = 8.03, p = 0.001, η² = 0.286 ⭐⭐
      - Poor WiFi significantly increases daily time lost
   
   3. Peak Performance → Time Lost: F(3,20) = 6.66, p = 0.003, η² = 0.250 ⭐⭐
      - Poor peak performance increases time lost
   
   4. Peak Performance → Task Abandonment: F(3,20) = 3.90, p = 0.024, η² = 0.163 ⭐
      - Poor peak performance increases task abandonment

===============================================================================
PHASE 4: POST-HOC ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION
===============================================================================

4.1 TUKEY'S HSD POST-HOC TEST
   Analyzed the most significant finding (WiFi Speed → Task Abandonment):
   
   PAIRWISE COMPARISONS:
   • Very Poor vs Poor WiFi: Mean difference = 1.70, p < 0.001 ✓
   • Very Poor vs Average WiFi: Mean difference = 2.45, p < 0.001 ✓
   • Very Poor vs Good WiFi: Mean difference = 2.50, p < 0.001 ✓
   • Poor vs Average: Not significant
   • Poor vs Good: Not significant
   • Average vs Good: Not significant
   
   CONCLUSION: Very poor WiFi creates significantly more task abandonment than all other categories

4.2 ANOVA ASSUMPTIONS TESTING
   
   NORMALITY CHECK (Shapiro-Wilk Test):
   • WiFi Speed Score: W = 0.864, p = 0.004 (❌ Not Normal)

   • Productivity Influence Score: W = 0.918, p = 0.052 (✅ Normal)
   
   HOMOGENEITY OF VARIANCE (Levene's Test):
   • WiFi Speed groups: W = 0.190, p = 0.902 (✅ Homogeneous)
   
   ASSESSMENT: Some normality violations, but ANOVA is robust to moderate violations

4.3 EFFECT SIZE INTERPRETATION
   Applied Cohen's conventions for η² (eta-squared):
   • Small effect: η² ≥ 0.01
   • Medium effect: η² ≥ 0.06  
   • Large effect: η² ≥ 0.14
   
   RESULTS: 4 large effects found, indicating practical significance
